# Plate Detection
This project aims to detect the vehicleâ€™s license plates using a combination of a pretrained model (VGG16) and a deep neural network (DNN). The pretrained model is used to extract features from the input images, and the DNN is used to classify the images into license plate or non-license plate regions.
